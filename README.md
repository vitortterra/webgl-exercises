# WebGL exercises

This repo contains the most interesting exercises (and some assignments) from my Introduction to Computer Graphics course.


Coursework was mostly based on [this course](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/427/) by Prof. David Mount at the University of Maryland.


* **Rotating cube**: a cube that can rotate around X, Y or Z axis and a Phong point light source ([demo](https://vitortterra.github.io/webgl-exercises/rotating-cube) \| [source](https://github.com/vitortterra/webgl-exercises/tree/main/rotating-cube)).

* **Shadow**: a square and its moving shadow  ([demo](https://vitortterra.github.io/webgl-exercises/shadow) \| [source](https://github.com/vitortterra/webgl-exercises/tree/main/shadow)).

* **Earth**: a world satellite picture wrapped around a rotating sphere, so that it looks like our planet  ([demo](https://vitortterra.github.io/webgl-exercises/earth) \| [source](https://github.com/vitortterra/webgl-exercises/tree/main/earth)).

* **Follow the leader**: an arbitrary number of "boids" follow a keyboard-controlled
leader and automatically avoid obstacles ([demo](https://vitortterra.github.io/webgl-exercises/follow-the-leader) \| [source](https://github.com/vitortterra/webgl-exercises/tree/main/follow-the-leader) \| [reference](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)).

* **Submarine**: a model of the bottom of the ocean with several submarines. You can switch
to the point of view to each one of them  ([demo](https://vitortterra.github.io/webgl-exercises/submarine) \| [source](https://github.com/vitortterra/webgl-exercises/tree/main/submarine)).
