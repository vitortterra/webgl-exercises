# WebGL exercises

This repo contains the most interesting exercises (and some assignments) from my Introduction to Computer Graphics course.


Coursework was mostly based on [this course](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/427/) by Prof. David Mount at the University of Maryland.


* [Rotating cube](/rotating-cube): a cube that can rotate around X, Y or Z axis and a Phong point light source.

* [Shadow](/shadow): a square and its moving shadow.
